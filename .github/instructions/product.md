# Product Overview
A specification-driven development workflow that provides structured templates and instructions for guiding development with GitHub Copilot. The system codifies project requirements, architecture, and implementation guidelines in markdown files that serve as authoritative sources of truth for both human developers and AI coding assistants.

## Target Users & Jobs-to-be-Done
- **Developer using GitHub Copilot** — key jobs: receiving accurate, context-aware code suggestions; pains addressed: inconsistent code quality, lack of project context; gains expected: faster development, consistent implementation patterns.
- **Technical Lead** — key jobs: ensuring team adherence to project standards; pains addressed: inconsistent implementations across team members; gains expected: uniform codebase, reduced code review overhead.
- **Product Manager** — key jobs: ensuring feature implementation aligns with product requirements; pains addressed: misinterpretation of requirements; gains expected: accurate implementation, reduced rework.

## Core Value Proposition
- We optimise for: **consistent implementation patterns**, **clear project context for AI assistants**, **reduced ambiguity in requirements**.
- We trade off: **flexibility in implementation approaches**, **rapid prototyping without structure**, **informal documentation practices**.

## Key Capabilities
### Must-haves
- Provide clear product context for coding agents through structured markdown specifications.
- Define engineering guardrails that constrain implementation choices while enabling creativity.
- Establish security and data handling requirements that protect sensitive information.
- Document technical stack and build system to ensure consistent development environments.
- Define repository structure conventions to maintain organized codebase.

### Nice-to-haves
- Provide UX guidelines for consistent user interface design.
- Offer API standards documentation for service integrations.

## Platforms & Interfaces
- **Web:** primary user experience through VS Code with GitHub Copilot integration.
- **CLI:** Justfile commands for common development tasks.
- **API:** Not directly applicable, but specifications may define API contracts for services.
- **Integrations:** GitHub Copilot, Nx monorepo tools, Just task runner, Docker containerization.

## Constraints & Guardrails
- **Security:** Authentication and authorization must follow least-privilege principles; encryption in transit and at rest required for sensitive data.
- **Privacy/Data:** PII must be handled according to data governance policies; retention and deletion policies must be clearly defined.
- **Performance/SLOs:** System should respond to user inputs within 200ms for optimal developer experience.
- **Availability/Recovery:** Specifications should be version-controlled with clear audit trails; recovery procedures for lost work.
- **Compliance/Legal:** Open-source usage must comply with organizational policies; third-party service boundaries clearly defined.
- **Architecture guardrails:** Prefer standardized generators over hand-rolled scaffolding; enforce hexagonal boundaries.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- We will not support automatic code generation without human review because quality assurance requires human judgment.
- We will not implement real-time collaboration features before establishing core specification patterns.
- We will not create visual design tools as the focus is on code specification and generation.

## Success Metrics
### Leading (adoption & usability)
- TTFHW (time to first happy workflow) ≤ 30 minutes for new team members.
- Weekly active users ≥ 90% of development team within 4 weeks of onboarding.
- Task success rate ≥ 95% for specification-driven implementation tasks.

### Operational (reliability & performance)
- p95 latency ≤ 100 ms for specification document retrieval.
- Error budget: ≤ 1% per quarter for specification validation failures.
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) ≤ 15 minutes for specification-related issues.

### Lagging (business)
- Reduction in code review time by 40% within 6 months.
- Decrease in bug reports related to specification misinterpretation by 60% within 3 months.

## Release Themes & Priorities
1. **Establish core specification templates and workflow** — rationale: enable consistent development practices — priority: 1.
2. **Implement validation and linting for specifications** — rationale: ensure quality — priority: 2.
3. **Add advanced AI guidance features** — rationale: future enhancement — priority: 3.

## Decision Heuristics
- Prefer standardised generators (Nx/Just/cookiecutter) over hand-rolled scaffolding.
- Prefer API compatibility with widely adopted patterns when in doubt.
- Prefer portability (Docker/Kubernetes) over vendor-specific features unless a cost–benefit analysis justifies the lock-in.
- Do not leak PII into logs, traces or telemetry; scrub at source.
- Do not introduce technologies or dependencies that circumvent the CI lint/spec gates.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Over-reliance on AI-generated code without proper validation — **Mitigation:** Implement mandatory human review processes and testing requirements.
- **Risk:** Specification documents becoming outdated — **Mitigation:** Establish regular review cycles and version control practices.
