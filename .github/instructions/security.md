# Security Requirements

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implement authentication following industry best practices.
- Apply least-privilege principles to service accounts, roles, and IAM policies.
- Use secure token storage and transmission mechanisms.
- Implement proper session management with secure timeouts.

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens in source code.
- Use secure secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).

## Privacy and PII Handling
- Identify and classify all personally identifiable information (PII) handled by the system.
- Implement data retention and deletion policies in accordance with legal requirements.
- Scrub PII from logs, traces, and telemetry data.
- Obtain proper consent for data collection and processing.

## Input Validation and Sanitization
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection).
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive system information.
- Use parameterized queries for database operations.

## Secure Coding Practices
- Follow secure coding guidelines for all supported languages.
- Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
- Conduct security reviews for all third-party libraries and services.
- Implement security testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Log security-relevant events for audit and monitoring purposes.
- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information or secrets.
- Implement real-time monitoring for suspicious activities.
- Establish incident response procedures for security events.

## Compliance
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Follow organizational security policies and standards.
- Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing.
- Maintain security documentation and evidence for audits.
