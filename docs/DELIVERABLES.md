# Deliverables Summary

- Issues identified and addressed:
  - Added unit tests for Nx generators (service, argo-app, vault-secret)
  - Fixed vault-secret generator path sanitization bug (slash replacement)
- Test coverage: collected for generator sources (see coverage report under coverage/libs/nx-homelab-plugin)
- Remaining technical debt:
  - Expand infra tests (Pulumi mocks)
  - Align Jest/ts-jest versions
  - Harden scripts with safety checks
- Recommendations:
  - Enforce coverage thresholds in CI (80%)
  - Add generator input validation and idempotency checks
  - Introduce small Pulumi helper modules to isolate testable logic
