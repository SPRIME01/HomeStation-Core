# Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
HomeStation-Core is an Nx-managed homelab bootstrap focused on Kubernetes (K3s) with ArgoCD, Vault, Supabase, and Traefik. Code quality is generally good with clear task orchestration via justfile and Nx targets. The custom Nx plugin provides generators for service scaffolding, ArgoCD apps, and Vault policies. Tests were missing for generators; we added unit tests and fixed a bug in the vault-secret generator path handling. Infrastructure code (Pulumi) defines providers and namespaces and is ready for future expansion.

Key risks are environment coupling (cluster-dependent scripts), minimal runtime validation for generated assets, and limited automated coverage outside the Nx plugin. Dependencies are mostly current. Security posture depends on correct handling of .env and Vault bootstrap; docs emphasize not committing secrets.

## Technology Stack Overview
- Monorepo tooling: Nx 21.3.10, pnpm 10.14.0, Node.js 22.x (Volta managed)
- Languages: TypeScript (Nx plugin, Pulumi), Bash scripts, YAML (K8s), Python (optional service template)
- Testing: Jest via @nx/jest; ts-jest preset
- Infra-as-code: Pulumi (@pulumi/pulumi, @pulumi/kubernetes)
- Cluster tools: ArgoCD, Traefik, Vault, Supabase (via infra/ and scripts/)
- Command runner: justfile

## Architecture and Entry Points
- Nx workspace with two projects:
  - libs/nx-homelab-plugin: custom generators (service, argo-app, vault-secret)
  - infrastructure: Nx wrapper around Pulumi and Ansible targets
- Entry flows:
  - just init, lint, test, validate, doctor, vault_init, setup_supabase
  - Nx targets for lint/test/build (plugin), pulumi:* and ansible:* (infrastructure)
- Pattern: Infra monorepo with a small custom codebase and file-generation centric workflows (scaffolding + YAML/IaC)

## Functional Inventory
- Generator: service (python/node skeleton + Dockerfile, deps)
- Generator: argo-app (ArgoCD Application manifest)
- Generator: vault-secret (Vault policy HCL + setup script)
- Pulumi: Kubernetes provider + namespace provisioning (placeholders for charts)
- Scripts: Vault/Supabase setup and cluster health checks

## Code Quality Assessment
- Structure is clean; Nx targets configured. ESLint module boundaries enforced.
- Naming is consistent. Docs exist in docs/ and infra folders.
- Missing tests for generators addressed (now added). No tests for Pulumi yet (future work with unit fakes or preview parsing).

## Dependency Analysis
- Nx 21.3.10; Jest 30; ts-jest 29.x; TypeScript 5.4.x root.
- Pulumi libs reasonably current (@pulumi 3.x, kubernetes 4.x).
- Minor mismatch: ts-jest v29 with jest v30; currently works via nx preset but consider aligning.
- Dev dependencies only in workspace; infra has its own package.json.

## Performance Considerations
- Nx cache enabled; fast lint/test. Generators use formatFiles which may be slow in CI; acceptable.
- Pulumi previews in lint may be slow when misconfigured; wrapped with || echo to avoid failures.

## Gaps & Issues
- Testing: No coverage for infrastructure code or scripts.
- Vault-secret generator bug with path sanitization (fixed to replace all '/').
- Jest warnings from formatFiles dynamic import when running under Node without vm modules; warnings only, tests pass.
- No coverage reporting configured in root run; generator project has default coverage dir but not enforced.
- Security: Shell scripts assume cluster context; recommend dry-run/safety checks.

## Intended vs Current State
- Intended: One-command bootstrap and generation of microservices and infra apps.
- Current: Core scaffolding works; infra Pulumi is skeletal; cluster commands require local K3s.

## Issue Classification
- Critical: None identified in code paths; security depends on runtime environment.
- High: Testing gaps outside plugin; version alignment (jest/ts-jest) to avoid future breakage.
- Medium: Improve generator validation (input schema constraints, existence checks, idempotency).
- Low: Docs could add an architecture overview diagram and testing guidance.
