# How to Manage K3s Containers via Rancher Desktop on Windows

This guide walks you through the essential steps to effectively manage K3s containers using Rancher Desktop on a Windows system. It assumes you have Rancher Desktop installed and WSL2 enabled.

## 🧠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- Windows 10/11 with [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed
- Rancher Desktop installed and configured
- A WSL2 Linux distro (e.g., Ubuntu) available
- Basic familiarity with `kubectl` and container runtimes

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Verify WSL2 Integration

Rancher Desktop runs K3s inside WSL2. Confirm WSL2 is functioning:

```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```

Ensure your distro is running under version 2.

---

## 🐳 Step 2: Choose the Right Container Runtime

In Rancher Desktop:

1. Open **Preferences**
2. Navigate to **Container Runtime**
3. Choose between:
   - `containerd` (default, lightweight)
   - `dockerd (moby)` (for Docker compatibility)

Click **Apply & Restart** to activate changes.

---

## 📦 Step 3: Access Kubernetes Context

Rancher Desktop automatically configures your `kubeconfig`. To verify:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context rancher-desktop
```

This ensures you're targeting the correct local K3s cluster.

---

## 🔐 Step 4: Expose Docker Socket and Kubeconfig to WSL2

Inside your WSL2 distro (e.g., Ubuntu), run:

```bash
ln -s /mnt/wsl/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock
mkdir -p ~/.kube
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<YourUser>/.kube/config ~/.kube/config
```

Replace `<YourUser>` with your actual Windows username. This enables CLI tools like `kubectl`, `helm`, and `docker` inside WSL2.

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Troubleshoot Pod Failures

To diagnose pod issues:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

Look for statuses like `CrashLoopBackOff` or `ImagePullBackOff`. These often indicate:

- Misconfigured containers
- Missing images
- Failing health probes

---

## 🧰 Step 6: Automate with Provisioning Scripts

Create a `.start` script inside your WSL2 distro to automate setup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
kubectl create namespace dev
kubectl apply -f /home/user/manifests/app.yaml
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.start
```

This script runs automatically when Rancher Desktop starts.

---

## 🧮 Step 7: Tune Resource Allocation

In Rancher Desktop:

1. Open **Preferences**
2. Go to **Virtual Machine**
3. Adjust CPU and memory limits to suit your workload

This prevents performance bottlenecks during container orchestration.

---

## ✅ Summary

By following these steps, you’ll have a robust and efficient workflow for managing K3s containers via Rancher Desktop on Windows. You’ll be able to:

- Seamlessly use Kubernetes tools inside WSL2
- Automate cluster setup
- Troubleshoot container issues effectively
- Optimize system resources

```
